<h1>Installation on Unix systems</h1>

<p>The first step in installation is compilation of the C modules.
There is currently only one C module, the netCDF interface module.
If you do not need the netCDF module, you can skip the compilation
step. If you do want to compile it, you must first install the netCDF
library, version 3 or higher. Then copy the file Src/Setup.in to
Src/Setup and edit the copy to reflect the installation of the netCDF
library on your system. If the library archive is in /usr/local/lib and
the header files in /usr/local/include, nothing has to be changed.
Once the file Src/Setup is ready, type "./compile" in the
top directory of the distribution.

<p>The second step is the installation of ScientificPython in a
publicly accessible place. This is done by typing "./install" in the
top directory of the distribution. This copies the directory
Scientific to the directory site-packages in the standard Python
library. Depending on the location of this directory, installation of
ScientificPython may require root privileges. However,
ScientificPython can also be installed manually by copying the
directory Scientific with all its contents into a directory on the
Python search path.
