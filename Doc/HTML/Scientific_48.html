<h1>Module Scientific.indexing</h1>





<p>This module provides a convenient method for constructing
array indices algorithmically. It provides one importable object,
<tt>index_expression</tt>.</p>



<p>For any index combination, including slicing and axis insertion,
<tt>a[indices]</tt> is the same as <tt>a[index_expression[indices]]</tt> for any
array <tt>a</tt>. However, <tt>index_expression[indices]</tt> can be used anywhere
in Python code and returns a tuple of indexing objects that can be
used in the construction of complex index expressions.</p>



<p>Sole restriction: Slices must be specified in the double-colon
form, i.e. a[::] is allowed, whereas a[:] is not.
